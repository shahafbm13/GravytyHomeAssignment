done - Instead of putting all the drivers and everything as input to the function put them as members of the class
changed path string to variable, unsure how to better the implementation - implement a variable -
			 if (driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html/body/div[5]/div[3]/div/div/div/div/div[2]/div/div/main/div/section/div[2]/div[2]/div/button")).isDisplayed()) {
                        driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html/body/div[5]/div[3]/div/div/div/div/div[2]/div/div/main/div/section/div[2]/div[2]/div/button")).click();
swapped extract connections to switch-case instead of ifs

handle errors - talk with ziv
its not common to upload the resources you're using

removed results from git - remove people from the results, that's kind of a privacy violation

2nd part
add class for api_info like login info


split to two files, one for each task
